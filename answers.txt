-- What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Ignore files which are added to this gitignore
-- What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch.
In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.
-- Why should you have different branches?
So that every developer can work independently on their own changes locally. 
This also helps in less chance of corrupting main branch.
-- In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
   * origin  https://github.com/Brusuvain/assign-git.git (fetch)
   * origin  https://github.com/Brusuvain/assign-git.git (push)
Generally these two remotes are configured for a repository.
